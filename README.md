# CrapTasktic

I wanted to use Robo, but I've got an environment that only has PHP 5.3.  

The first thing I said was "well, this is craptastic."  And like that, a framework was born.

**CrapTasktic**: A Task Runner that's compatible with a terribly old version of PHP (i.e. 5.3).

## Warning.

If you have PHP 5.4+ please use [Robo](http://robo.li/).  

In fact, this library is a port of Robo with some changes to make it fit our environment better.
